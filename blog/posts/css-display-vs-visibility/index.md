## Overview

Do you know the difference between `display: none;` and `visibility: hidden;`? Well don't worry as I am about to show you! These two declarations, which is a rule to control how a selector is styled, have different use cases.

## Display Property

This will hide the object without taking up space:

``` CSS
display: none;
```

## Visibility Property

This will hide the object but keep the space:

``` CSS
visibility: hidden;
```
