Hey everyone!

This is my first post on my new website! I created this website using GatsbyJS and is hosted on Netlify. So far, I like the theme colors and font. I have a lot of work to do on projects page and I want to add additional functionality to my blog such as categories and tags. For now, this is a good starting place and I plan to add more articles to this site soon.

I plan to add articles related to my interests which include technology, leadership, motorcycles, and firearms. For years I went back and forth on the type of website I should have whether it was a technology blog or some other site on a different topic and could never come to something that satisfied me. So, on this site, I am not sticking to a single interest but will instead entertain all my interests.

I have chosen the .dev domain because my primary interest is technology and web development and I foresee most of my articles being related to that.

Thanks for visiting!
