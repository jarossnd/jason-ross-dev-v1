## Overview

Comments are not executed and are ignored. Comments are a way to leave notes to yourself or other developers on what a piece of code does. There are two types of comments, single in-line comments and multi-line comments:

In-line comment example:

```JavaScript
// this is an in-line comment
```

Multi-line comment example:

```JavaScript
/* this is a 
multi-line comment */
```

You should add comments to your code frequently to describe the intent and purpose of what the code does.
