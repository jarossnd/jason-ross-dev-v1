        I am a full stack JavaScript web developer from the United States. Building and troubleshooting problems is
            what I love to do. Besides knowing a lot about web development, I also know a thing or two about SharePoint
            and PowerShell. Did I mention that I also create technology courses? Stick around if you want to learn more
            about what I do.
